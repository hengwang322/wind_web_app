# Wind Power Prediction: Web App

This is the repository of the web app for my [Wind Power Prediction project](https://github.com/hengwang322/wind_power_prediction). This web app  continuously streams in real-time weather data from DarkSky API and predicts the power output for major wind farms in South Australia.
